# Bob's discount Tv show program
# Java Tv Show program that allows a user to create an account, login, see all avaialable shows, see thier show progresses and update thier show progress.
### Proposal
We wanted an easy way for people to be able to see how much of a show they have viewed. By doing so users can moniter up to 10 of the most watched shows on televsion. We believe that this implementation will allow users to watch as much tv programming as possible.   The app can be seen on a webpage and will interact with a java backend for flawless execution of feature. Further implementations will be more shows with enhanced UI and purchasing options.
